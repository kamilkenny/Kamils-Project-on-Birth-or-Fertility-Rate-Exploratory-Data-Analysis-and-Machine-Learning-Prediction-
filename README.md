# Executive Summary: Fertility Rate Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project explores global birth/fertility rate trends and applies machine learning techniques to predict future fertility patterns. The work begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global fertility rate datasets, uncovering key insights on demographic shifts, regional disparities, and socio-economic factors influencing reproductive behavior.

The dataset was sourced from reputable public databases (e.g., World Bank) and includes features such as fertility rate per woman, GDP per capita, education levels, urbanization rates, and health indicators across different countries and time periods.

The EDA phase includes:

Descriptive statistics and data cleaning

Correlation heatmaps to identify key influencing factors

Time series visualizations of regional trends

Comparative analysis between low-, middle-, and high-income countries

Following EDA, multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were trained to predict fertility rates based on the identified features. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and R² scores, with the goal of supporting data-driven policy decisions in population health, education, and economic planning.

This project showcases end-to-end data science workflow—from data acquisition and preprocessing to model development and interpretation—highlighting the role of AI in demographic forecasting.
